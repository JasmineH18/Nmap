Environments Used:
-Kali Linux in Virtualbox

Started Kali Linux virtual machine and opened Nmap. This project will be detecting operating systems using Nmap.

Opened an extra for nmap manual. This will list all the commands I can use and the description for it. Screenshot https://imgur.com/mBIUIob
In the terminal:
man nmap

Another option for shorten information as a guide. Screenshot https://imgur.com/tsVmjxz 
In the terminal:
nmap --help

-O enables OS detection. This feature can detect operating system the target host is using. 

In the terminal:
sudo nmap -O 45.33.32.205 -v

It pinged the host to check if it's active. Checked for open ports using TCP three-way handshake, but it's doing a stealth scan. Lastly it will guess what OS it's using. -v revealed more information.
