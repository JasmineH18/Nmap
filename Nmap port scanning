I've already practiced Nmap in Tryhackme (https://tryhackme.com/room/furthernmap) and will do this project on Kali Linux virtual machine from VirtualBox.  This will be a guided project. Guided projects are hands on training. You follow what the teacher is doing on your software, hardware, etc. This will improve your skills on a certain subject. Below are the resources and environments I'm using.

Resources Used:
-https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
-https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms
-Networkchuck https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4kBkMsDbQ
-https://nmap.org/book/man.html

Environments Used:
-Kali Linux in Virtualbox

Started Kali Linux virtual machine and opened Nmap. This project will be on port scanning using Nmap.

I will be using one of Nmap's IP address that is allowed to be used. From Nmap reference guide in the description section, I'll be using Example 15.1 to get an IP address to use. Start with scanning 'scanme.nmap.org'.  

In the terminal:
nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

-A will enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute
-T4 will speed up the scanning process

Nmap provided an IP address I can use, which is 45.33.32.156. I ping the IP address to make sure the host is up and running. 'ping' sends ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts and will see if it'll get an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway.

In the terminal:
ping 45.33.32.156

The ping was a success!
