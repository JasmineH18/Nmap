-Kali Linux in Virtualbox

Started Kali Linux virtual machine and opened Nmap. This project will be on using a decoy using Nmap.

Opened an extra for nmap manual. This will list all the commands I can use and the description for it. Screenshot https://imgur.com/mBIUIob
In the terminal:
man nmap

Another option for shorten information as a guide. Screenshot https://imgur.com/tsVmjxz

-D will cloak a scan with decoys. You can use a decoy to avoid being found while scanning the network and it is called obfuscation.

Example:
sudo nmap -sS -D 192.2.1.60 45.33.32.156

I used -sS to do a stealth scan. -D and a decoy IP address (-D 192.2.1.60). Lastly my target IP address (45.33.32.156) 

While scanning, it will send packets that I'm the source. It will aslo send a duplicate and change the source to 192.2.1.60. Someone checking traffic on the network will see an increase of traffic from all these hosts. Decoy is sending packets from multiple decoy IP addresses.
