Started Kali Linux virtual machine and opened Nmap. This project will be stealth mode scan using Nmap.

Opened an extra for nmap manual. This will list all the commands I can use and the description for it. Screenshot https://imgur.com/mBIUIob

SYN Scan (-sS) are known as stealth scanning and half open scans. Used in network reconnaissance. It's used to gather information from a target systems without alerting the targets network Intrusion Detection Systems. When the stealth scan starts it will terminate the three-way connection after the SYN/ACK flag is sent. the target Firewalls and access control list will not be alerted. 

Example: 
Device 20 will send a SYN flag to a web server as it wants to start a connection.

If the port is open, the web server will send a SYN/ACK flag to Device 20.

Device 20 will not complete the TCP connection, which will not complete the three-way handshake.

In the terminal:
Sudo nmap -sS -p 80,443,22,143,21 45.33.32.156/24 -v

It can the entire network and the firewall was not alerted.
