Started Kali Linux virtual machine and opened Nmap. This project will be on Nmap Scripting Engine with vulnerability scanning using Nmap.

Opened an extra for nmap manual. This will list all the commands I can use and the description for it. Screenshot https://imgur.com/mBIUIob
In the terminal:
man nmap

Another option for shorten information as a guide. Screenshot https://imgur.com/tsVmjxz 
In the terminal:
nmap --help

NSE is short for Nmap Scripting Engine and is a very powerful feature. NSE Scripts are written in the Lua programming language. It allows you to write and share scripts to automate a wide variety of networking tasks. You can scan for vulnerabilities, vulnerability exploitation, Network discovery, and other things. 

NOTE: It's advisable to never run scripts from a third party, unless you trust the authors. Scripts are not run in a sandbox.

In the terminal: 
sudo nmap --script vuln 45.33.32.156

--script allows me to select specific scripts or script categories against target hosts.
vuln will check for all known vulnerabilities.

Depending on the results, you may see CVE. CVE is short for Common Vulnerabilitie and Exposure. It is a reference for publicly known vulnerabilities and exposures. The webiste is https://cve.mitre.org/

Results: 
Found the following possible CSRF vulnerabilities:

  Path: http://scanme.nmap.org:80/
  form id: nst-head-search
  Form action: /search/

  Path: http://scanme.nmap.org:80/
  form id: nst-foot-search
  Form action: /search/

CSRF is short for Cross-Site Request Forgery. It's a web security vulnerability. An attacker will trick an authenticated user to make a malicious request. You can learn more on https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf

Example 2
In the terminal:
nmap -p 80,443 --script http-apache-server-status 45.33.32.222/24 -v

-p: Specify which port to scan for. 
--script: To start a script
http-apache-server-status: This script will look for misconfigured apchahe web servers and will give information.

Example 3
In the terminal:
nmap -p 80,443 --script http-methods 45.33.32.17 -v

-p: Specify which port to scan for. 
--script: To start a script
http-methods: This script will find what options are available from certain web servers.

45.33.32.17: The target

Results: The script scan returned a trace method. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. This can be an Internal authentication header appended by reverse proxies or other information that you can take and use a step further. 

Example 4:
In the terminal:
nmap -p80,443 --script http-errors 45.33.32.11
