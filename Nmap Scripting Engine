Started Kali Linux virtual machine and opened Nmap. This project will be on port Nmap scripts using Nmap.

Opened an extra for nmap manual. This will list all the commands I can use and the description for it. Screenshot https://imgur.com/mBIUIob

NSE is short for Nmap Scripting Engine and is a very powerful feature. NSE Scripts are written in the Lua programming language. It allows you to write and share scripts to automate a wide variety of networking tasks. You can scan for vulnerabilities, vulnerability exploitation, Network discovery, and other things. 

NOTE: It's advisable to never run scripts from a third party, unless you trust the authors. Scripts are not run in a sandbox.

In the terminal: 
sudo nmap --script vuln 45.33.32.156

--script allows me to select specific scripts or script categories against target hosts.
vuln will check for all known vulnerabilities.

Depending on the results, you may see CVE. CVE is short for Common Vulnerabilitie and Exposure. It is a reference for publicly known vulnerabilities and exposures. The webiste is https://cve.mitre.org/
