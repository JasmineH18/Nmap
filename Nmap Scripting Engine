Started Kali Linux virtual machine and opened Nmap. This project will be on Nmap Scripting Engine with vulnerability scanning using Nmap.

Opened an extra for nmap manual. This will list all the commands I can use and the description for it. Screenshot https://imgur.com/mBIUIob
In the terminal:
man nmap

Another option for shorten information as a guide. Screenshot https://imgur.com/tsVmjxz 
In the terminal:
nmap --help

NSE is short for Nmap Scripting Engine and is a very powerful feature. NSE Scripts are written in the Lua programming language. It allows you to write and share scripts to automate a wide variety of networking tasks. You can scan for vulnerabilities, vulnerability exploitation, Network discovery, and other things. 

NOTE: It's advisable to never run scripts from a third party, unless you trust the authors. Scripts are not run in a sandbox.

In the terminal: 
sudo nmap --script vuln 45.33.32.156

--script allows me to select specific scripts or script categories against target hosts.
vuln will check for all known vulnerabilities.

Depending on the results, you may see CVE. CVE is short for Common Vulnerabilitie and Exposure. It is a reference for publicly known vulnerabilities and exposures. The webiste is https://cve.mitre.org/

Results: 
Found the following possible CSRF vulnerabilities:

  Path: http://scanme.nmap.org:80/
  form id: nst-head-search
  Form action: /search/

  Path: http://scanme.nmap.org:80/
  form id: nst-foot-search
  Form action: /search/

CSRF is short for Cross-Site Request Forgery. It's a web security vulnerability. An attacker will trick an authenticated user to make a malicious request. You can learn more on https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf

HTTP Scripts

Example 1:
In the terminal:
nmap -sV --script http-csrf 45.33.32.213 -v

-sV: Will tell us the service/version info
--script: To start a script
http-csrf: This is the script number 
45.33.32.213: The target

Example 2:
http-apache-server-status: This script will look for misconfigured apchahe web servers and will give information. 

In the terminal:
nmap -p 80,443 --script http-apache-server-status 45.33.32.222/24 -v

-p: Specify which port to scan for. 
--script: To start a script
45.33.32.222/24: The target 
Results: 45.33.32.17 showed a misconfigured apchahe web server
Screenshots: https://imgur.com/vdEGl1V, https://imgur.com/uLaeShn

Example 3:
http-methods: This script will find what options are available from certain web servers.

In the terminal:
nmap -p 80,443 --script http-methods 45.33.32.17 -v

-p: Specify which port to scan for. 
--script: To start a script
45.33.32.17: The target
Screeshot: https://imgur.com/cQvN8Yl
Results: The script scan returned a trace method. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. This can be an Internal authentication header appended by reverse proxies or other information that you can take and use a step further. 

Example 4:
http-errors: This script will crawl through the website and look for any error pages it can find.

In the terminal:
nmap -p80,443 --script http-errors 45.33.32.11 -v

-p: Specify which port to scan for. 
--script: To start a script
45.33.32.11: The target
Screeshot: https://imgur.com/pc9Mn2u
Results: It found an error message in port 443. Error Code: 404

Example 5:
http-grep.nse: This script goes out in spiders or crawls a website and attempts to find on the various pages of the website information. By default, it will look for IP addresses and email addresses. Also look for first name and others.

In the terminal:
nmap -p 80,443 --script http-grep.nse 45.33.32.5 -v

-p: Specify which port to scan for. 
--script: To start a script
45.33.32.5: The target
Screeshot: https://imgur.com/QNIv3ud
Results: It found an email address on port 80

Example 6: 
http-wordpress-enum: This script will look for plugins that are running on the site.

In the terminal: 
nmap -p 80,443 --script http-wordpress-enum.nse 45.33.32.17 -v

-p: Specify which port to scan for. 
--script: To start a script
45.33.32.17: The target
Screeshot: https://imgur.com/7KDk7sK
Results: It found up to 100 themes/plugins in port 443.


DNS Brute Script

dns-brute: This script looks for subdomnains of a parent domain. Example: DNS brute script would look for subdomains for domain Google.com. Subdomains appear in different servers, and will be part of vulnerability scanning.

Example: 
In the terminal: 
nmap -p 80,443 --script dns-brute scanme.nmap.org -v

-p: Specify which port to scan for. 
--script: To start a script
scanme.nmap.org: The target
Screeshot: https://imgur.com/ZsO63aM
Results: It show the IP the scan was running on. The IP is 45.33.32.156 and it matches to the same server. There is a A record that is a different server with a IP address 45.33.49.119.
 

SMB Script:

smb-protocol: This script will ask the servers what SMB protocol do you support.

Example 1: 
nmap -sT -p 445 -iL iplist.txt --script smb-protocols

-sT: Is a TCP connect scan. It's a full open scan.
-p: Specify which port to scan for. Port 445 is commonly associated with Server Message Block.
-iL iplist.txt: This will read a list of target IP addresses from the file 'iplist.txt'
--script: To start a script
