I've already practiced Nmap in Tryhackme (https://tryhackme.com/room/furthernmap) and will do this project on Kali Linux virtual machine from VirtualBox. Below are the resources and environments I'm using.

Resources Used:

Environments Used:
-Kali Linux in Virtualbox

Started Kali Linux virtual machine and opened Nmap. This project will be on aggressive mode using Nmap.

Opened an extra for nmap manual. This will list all the commands I can use and the description for it. Screenshot https://imgur.com/mBIUIob
In the terminal:
man nmap

Another option for shorten information as a guide. Screenshot https://imgur.com/tsVmjxz 
In the terminal:
nmap --help

-A is short for Aggressive and it will enable aggressive scanning. It will enable OS detection, show versions of protocols, do script scanning, and taceroute.

In the terminal:
sudo nmap -A 45.33.32.156 -v

It pinged the host to check if it's active. Checked for open ports using TCP three-way handshake, but it's doing a stealth scan. It showed the ssh host key and the version I am using. Also show we are using Apache and using Ubuntu with protocol 2.0. It completed the traceroute to see how many hops it takes.
