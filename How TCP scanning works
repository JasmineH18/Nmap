This information will be on how TCP scan works in nmap.

TCP Connect Scans (-sT) are known as full open scan uses a three-way handshake.

TCP is short for Transmission Control Protocol. TCP is a communication protocol that starts a conversation with another device. The conversation is the three-way handshake. 

Nmap uses this process when scanning for open ports.

There are three stages to three-way handshake.

Stage 1: SYN short for synchronize
Device 1 wants to start a conversation with Device 2. Device 1 would ask Device 2 are you there in port 443 with a SYN flag. This where SYN starts.

Stage 2: SYN/ACK short for synchronize/acknowledge
Device 2 would send a SYN/ACK flag to Device 1 to let it know it received it's message and ready to talk.

Stage 3: ACK short for acknowledge
Device 1 would send an ACK flag to talk.


If a port is closed?
Device 1 wants to start a conversation with Device 2. Device 1 would ask Device 2 are you there in port 443 with a SYN flag. This where SYN starts.

Device 2 port 443 is closed, so the device server will respond wiith a RST flag.

This means port 443 is closed.

RST short for reset. It means the connection is terminated.


What if the port is not closed?
Device 1 wants to start a conversation with Device 2. Device 1 would ask Device 2 are you there in port 443 with a SYN flag. This where SYN starts.

Device 1 did not received a response. 

It means Device 2 is hidden behind a firewall or access crontrol lists. The firewall is configured to drop incoming packets. 

This means the port is filtered.


A firewall can be configure to respond with a RST flag.
Device 1 wants to start a conversation with Device 2. Device 1 would ask Device 2 are you there in port 443 with a SYN flag. This where SYN starts.

Device 2 responded to Device 1 with a RST flag.

This means the port is filtered.
