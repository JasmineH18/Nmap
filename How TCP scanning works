I've already practiced Nmap in Tryhackme (https://tryhackme.com/room/furthernmap) and will do this project on Kali Linux virtual machine from VirtualBox. Below are the resources and environments I'm using.

Environments Used:
-Kali Linux in Virtualbox

Started Kali Linux virtual machine and opened Nmap. This project will be on how TCP scanning works in nmap.

Opened an extra for nmap manual. This will list all the commands I can use and the description for it. Screenshot https://imgur.com/mBIUIob
In the terminal:
man nmap

Another option for shorten information as a guide. Screenshot https://imgur.com/tsVmjxz
