I've already practiced Nmap in Tryhackme (https://tryhackme.com/room/furthernmap) and will do this project on Kali Linux virtual machine from VirtualBox. Below are the resources and environments I'm using.

This information will be on how TCP scan works in nmap.

TCP Connect Scans (-sT) also known as full open scan uses a three-way handshake.

TCP is short for Transmission Control Protocol. TCP is a communication protocol that starts a conversation with another device. The conversation is the three-way handshake. 

Nmap uses this process when scanning for open ports.

There are three stages to three-way handshake.

Stage 1: SYN short for synchronize
Device 1 wants to start a conversation with Device 2. Device 1 would ask Device 2 are you there in port 443?. This where SYN starts.

Stage 2: SYN/ACK short for synchronize/acknowledge
Device 2 would send a SYN/ACK to Device 1 to let it know it received it's message and ready to talk.

Stage 3: ACK short for acknowledge
Device 1 would send an ACK to talk
