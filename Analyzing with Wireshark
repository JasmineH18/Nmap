-Wireshark in Kali Linux

Started Kali Linux virtual machine and opened Nmap and Wireshark. This project will be on analyzing the port scan with Wireshark.

I'll do a full open scan, but will not specify a port. By default, it'll scan the top 1000 ports or popular ports. Only scanning one network. 

In the terminal:
Sudo nmap -sT 45.33.32.156 -v

I'll run the scan again with Wireshark. In Wireshark, clicked the shark fin icon to start the capture. Hovering over it with the mouse will show 'Start capturing packets'. 

The packets will start to show in Wireshark. In displayed filtered, types ip.addr == 45.33.32.156
